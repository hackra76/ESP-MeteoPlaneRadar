// 0.7.0 drew each label as one line of size-1 text just outside a fat ring, and
// on the panel the two ran into each other: eight pixels of grey sitting on the
// edge of a bright sector is unreadable whatever it says. The fix is not a
// bigger gap - it is a thinner ring and bigger labels. Each label is now two
// lines at size 2, the source above its percentage, with the ring pulled in far
// enough that the block has clear black around it.
//
// The trade figure moved into the middle for the same reason: at the foot of
// the panel it was competing with the bottom label for the one spot where the
// circle is narrowest.

// One group label: the source on top, its share underneath.
//
// The sizes are NOT fixed, and that is the whole point of this function.
//
// 0.7.1 put every label at size 2 on a fixed radius and they ran into the ring
// anyway. The reason is geometry that is easy to get wrong: a label is an
// UPRIGHT RECTANGLE placed on a radius, so its nearest CORNER sits closer to
// the centre than its centre does - by (w/2)|cos| + (h/2)|sin|. At the sides of
// the dial, where |cos| is 1, a 92 px wide block reaches 46 px further in than
// its own centre. Checking that the block fitted inside the glass, as 0.7.1
// did, says nothing about whether it clears the ring.
//
// So the radius is solved rather than fixed: pushed out until the near corner
// clears the ring by LBL_GAP, and rejected if the far corner then leaves the
// glass. A label at three o'clock therefore sits further out than one at
// twelve, which is exactly right - it needs the room.
//
// When even that fails, the label gets SMALLER rather than disappearing, which
// is the other half of the fix. The tiers are ordered so the first thing to go
// is the size of the NAME, not of the number: the number is what is being read,
// the name is a word you recognise by its shape and its colour. In practice
// tier 2 clears the ring at every angle for every name, so the label is only
// ever dropped when a neighbour has genuinely taken the space.
// The NUMBER never drops below size 2. That was the mistake in 0.7.3: hydro on
// an ordinary day is under one per cent, so it started on the smallest tier and
// got a label 6 px tall - drawn, claimed, correct, and invisible from a metre
// away, which is the only distance this screen is ever read from. "Quieter
// than its neighbours" has to stop well short of "illegible"; what shrinks for
// a small share is the NAME, and that is the whole of it.

// The outward step is what makes the top of this dial work at all. The small
