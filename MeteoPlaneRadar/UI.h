// changes rarely - the mix arrives every quarter of an hour, the forecast twice
// an hour - the clock therefore sat still between updates and looked frozen.
// Those screens call this from their Tick() so the minute keeps moving.
//

// temperature changing is caught too. One shared record of the last text is
// enough because only the active screen is ticked, and switching screens
